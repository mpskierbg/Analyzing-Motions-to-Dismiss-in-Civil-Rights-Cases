Project Overview

This project analyzes trends in federal district court rulings on Motions to Dismiss in civil rights cases brought under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. It mimics the core workflow of a Legal Data Analyst at Lex Machina, involving data acquisition via API, manual legal review, SQL analysis, and visualization.
Prerequisites

    Python 3.8+ installed on your system.

    A free CourtListener API key.

    Basic knowledge of the command line/terminal.

Setup & Installation

    Clone the repository:
    bash

git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-name>

Usage: Running the Analysis Pipeline

Execute the scripts in the following order:

1. Data Acquisition
This script fetches raw metadata for relevant court opinions from the CourtListener API.
bash

python data_acquisition.py

    What it does: Searches for opinions related to "motion to dismiss" and "42 U.S.C. ยง 1983". The results are saved to raw_opinions_data.csv.

    Note: The API's court filter can be unreliable. This script fetches a broad dataset and filters for district courts programmatically in the next step.

    Note: you may need to edit the params, I had problems with getting the correct courts.

2. Data Cleaning & Sampling
This script fetches the full text for each opinion and prepares a sample for manual review.
bash

Python extract_download_url.py

    What it does: extracted the url of the opionon in the csv. The results are saved to a new column.

Python extract_opinion_id.py

    What it does: extracted the opinion_id of the opionon in the csv. The results are saved to a new column.
    
python data_cleaning.py

    What it does:

        Loads csv with the updated csv.

        Makes individual API calls to fetch the full text (plain_text) for each opinion using its opinion_id.

        Makes individual API calls to fetch the url of the opinion in case there is no full text for each opinion using its                download_url.

        Creates a manageable random sample of opinions and saves it to sample_for_labeling.csv.

    Expectation: This step will take some time due to rate-limiting pauses between API calls.

3. Manual Labeling (Critical Step)
This is where you apply your legal expertise. This step cannot be automated.

    Open sample_for_labeling.csv in the spreadsheet software of your choice.

    For each row, read the plain_text of the judicial opinion or use the download_url.

    In the motion_granted column, label the outcome:

        1: Motion to Dismiss was Granted.

        0: Motion to Dismiss was Denied.

        -1: Outcome is unclear or opinion is irrelevant (will be filtered out).

    Save your changes to the CSV file.

4. Analysis & Visualization
This script analyzes your labeled data, runs SQL queries, and generates visualizations.
bash

python analysis_and_viz.py

    What it does:

        Loads your manually labeled data from your edits above.

        Filters out rows labeled -1.

        Performs SQL analysis to calculate grant rates, trends over time, and variations by circuit.

        Generates plots (grant_rate_trend.png) and saves it in the repository.

        Prints key findings to the console.

Files Overview

    data_acquisition.py: Fetches data from the CourtListener API.

    extract_download_url.py: adds new column to the csv file.

    extract_opinion_id.py: adds new column to the csv file.

    data_cleaning.py: Prepares data for manual labeling by fetching full text.

    analysis_and_viz.py: Performs data analysis and creates visualizations.

Troubleshooting & Notes

    API Rate Limiting: The CourtListener API has strict rate limits for free tiers. If scripts fail with 429 or 401 errors, wait an hour before trying again.

    No Results Found: If the acquisition script finds zero results, try simplifying the search query in data_acquisition.py (e.g., just "motion to dismiss") to test the connection or change the params.

    Column Errors: If you encounter a KeyError, run print(df.columns.tolist()) in your script to see the exact column names returned by the API and adjust your code accordingly.
